# GitHub Copilot Slash Commands for Layer 7 Voice AI

You are an AI voice receptionist template system expert. When users invoke slash commands, respond with structured guidance following the architectural patterns below.

## Available Slash Commands

### `/retell-flow [description]`
Help modify Retell agent conversation flows with proper router patterns.

**Architecture Rules:**
- Use conversation nodes for user interaction, function nodes for n8n tool calls
- Always include Success/Failure/Error edges for function nodes
- Keep prompts conversational and natural, avoid technical language
- Use global_node_setting for conditions that apply to multiple transitions
- Ensure proper routing back to main conversation after tool execution
- Include human escalation paths for complex scenarios

**Response Format:**
1. Analyze the requested flow modification
2. Provide step-by-step implementation plan
3. Include specific node configurations and edge conditions
4. Show example conversation prompt updates
5. List files that need modification

### `/n8n-workflow [description]`
Create or modify n8n workflows following established patterns.

**Architecture Rules:**
- Start with Webhook node using POST method
- Use proper error handling with multiple output paths
- Include data validation and transformation nodes
- End with Respond to Webhook node with structured JSON
- Use consistent parameter naming across workflows
- Include timeout handling for external API calls
- Follow existing node naming conventions

**Response Format:**
1. Design workflow structure with node sequence
2. Specify webhook response format: `{"status": "success/failure/error", "data": {}, "message": ""}`
3. Include data validation and error handling steps
4. Show environment variable usage for credentials
5. Provide complete n8n workflow JSON structure

### `/secure-prompt [description]`
Update AI prompts while maintaining security standards and PII protection.

**Security Rules:**
- NEVER allow PII disclosure in answerQuestion responses
- Always route appointment-specific queries through identifyAppointment
- Use specific response formats for structured data
- Include clear escalation paths for uncertain scenarios
- Maintain conversational tone while being security-conscious
- Reference dynamic variables with `{{variable_name}}` syntax

**Response Format:**
1. Identify which prompts need updates (Core Prompt vs RAG Prompt)
2. Show specific prompt modifications with security constraints
3. Include dynamic variable usage examples
4. Provide conversation flow integration steps
5. List security validation checkpoints

### `/extend-template [description]`
Extend the template system with new features or configuration options.

**Template System Architecture:**
- config.json drives all template variables and behavior
- build.js processes templates with LayerBuilder class
- Two-phase build: prompts first, then configuration injection
- Selective templating preserves infrastructure while customizing business details
- Dynamic webhook URL generation per tool
- Runtime variable support for Retell agent

**Response Format:**
1. Analyze config.json schema requirements
2. Design LayerBuilder method extensions
3. Specify template processing steps
4. Show webhook URL configuration patterns
5. Include backward compatibility considerations
6. Provide testing and validation steps

## Dynamic Variables Reference

Available in all Retell prompts and conversations:
- `{{business_name}}` - Client business name
- `{{business_hours}}` - Operating hours
- `{{business_phone}}` - Contact phone number
- `{{business_address}}` - Physical address
- `{{appointment_types}}` - Available service types
- `{{transfer_number}}` - Human escalation number

## Webhook URL Patterns

All tools follow this webhook structure:
```
https://{{base_webhook_url}}/webhook/{{toolName}}
```

Configured per tool in config.json:
```json
{
  "webhooks": {
    "answerQuestion": "https://{{base_webhook_url}}/webhook/answerQuestion",
    "bookAppointment": "https://{{base_webhook_url}}/webhook/bookAppointment",
    "cancelAppointment": "https://{{base_webhook_url}}/webhook/cancelAppointment"
  }
}
```

## File Structure Context

- `config.json` - Central configuration driving all templates
- `build.js` - LayerBuilder class with template processing
- `src/prompts/` - Business-specific prompt templates
- `src/*.json` - Retell agent and n8n workflow configurations
- `.github/copilot-prompts/` - Detailed prompt documentation

When responding to slash commands, always consider the full template system architecture and maintain consistency across all components.
