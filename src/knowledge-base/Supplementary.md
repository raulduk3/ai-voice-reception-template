## Haircut Types and Techniques
- **Scissor Cut**: Standard technique for shaping, trimming, and layering hair. Suitable for most medium to long hairstyles.  
- **Clipper Cut**: Uses electric clippers; common for short cuts, fades, and buzz styles.  
- **Razor Cutting**: Provides a softer, textured finish; often used for layered or feathered styles.  
- **Layering**: Reduces bulk, adds shape, or creates volume.  
- **Texturizing/Thinning**: Removes density without altering length; creates lightness and movement.  
- **Bangs/Fringe Cutting**: Short section at the front; length and style vary (blunt, side-swept, curtain).  

## Service Durations (Typical Industry Standards)
- **Basic Haircut**: 30–60 minutes  
- **Children’s Haircut**: 20–40 minutes  
- **Color (Single Process)**: 90–120 minutes

## Common Client Questions and Guidance
**How often should I get a haircut?**  
- Short styles: every 4–6 weeks  
- Medium/long styles: every 6–12 weeks  
- To grow hair out: trim every 10–12 weeks to maintain health  

**Does cutting hair make it grow faster?**  
No. Hair growth comes from the scalp. Cutting removes split ends, which helps hair appear healthier and prevents breakage.  

**Can I bring photos for reference?**  
Yes. Reference images are widely encouraged to ensure clear communication with the stylist.  

**What is the difference between highlights and balayage?**  
- **Highlights**: Foil or cap technique for lighter streaks with contrast.  
- **Balayage**: Hand-painted color that creates a natural, sun-kissed gradient.  

**Is coloring damaging to hair?**  
Yes, but professional products and aftercare reduce the damage. Conditioning treatments and sulfate-free shampoos are commonly recommended.  

## Aftercare and Maintenance
- **Post-Color Care**: Wait 24–48 hours before washing hair. Use sulfate-free, color-safe products. Limit heat styling.  
- **General Hair Health**: Regular trims prevent split ends; moisturizing treatments improve texture.  
- **Heat Styling Precautions**: Always use a thermal protectant spray.

- Sanitation requirements include:  
  - Disinfecting scissors, combs, and clippers between clients.
